# Reflections

Working on this project with Future Interns was transformative. I explored how AI can elevate creative processes â€” not just for automation but as a co-creator.

What I learned:
- How prompt engineering can influence visual outputs
- Using GitHub for clean project documentation
- Deploying on GitHub Pages

This task improved my creative thinking, technical skills, and workflow speed.
